My app is designed for a general audience, any Spotify Premium user. 

My app has two components: 

1. Random Shuffler Tool. A user types in the name of a playlist and the number of songs they would like added to their playback queue. That number of songs are randomly selected from the given playlist and added to their playback queue. 

2. All Songs Playlist Generator. When a user clicks "Create Playlist," the application takes all of their liked albums and all of their liked songs and compiles them into a single playlist.
